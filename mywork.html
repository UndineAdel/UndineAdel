                which is High Fidelity Mockups. To exicute them we used Adobe XD. When working with this program we use a lot of "filler" images and icons to
                better manage our time, that we
                later change in the later coding part of the project.

            <h3><span class = "green">Diabetes Association : Qualitative Interviews</span></h3>
            <p>As a part of our research, our team conducted qualitative interviews. It is a great way to get direct info from the products potential
                users. I like to use qualitative interviews in all of my projects, as they aren't too time consuming, and usualy provide me with an insight into the users
            thought process. Important part of qualitative interviews is the transcription of said interviews. I always do this as detailed as possible, to make it easier for myself 
        and others who might have to work with this interview. For this project we conducted 4 interviews and used all of them to create personas.</p>

            <h3><span class = "green">Diabetes Association : Perosnas</span> </h3>
            <p>A persona is a representation of many real users based on data. In my experience, it works together with qualitative interviews seamlesly. Creating
                a persona helps to extract the most important data from an interview and minimise repetetiveness. When creating a persona I always try to make them seem
                as real as possible, adding just a little bit of necessary fiction. For this particular project we made 2 personas, with a quite different backstory and needs,
                and then did our best to cater to them.

                <span class= "yellow">Project development method</span>- Rapid prototyping, focus on Low Fidelity Mock ups. We decided on this development method as we had 
                worked with it previously, it doesn't ask for such strict planning, as it is based more on "Trial and Error" and it helps avoid mistakes
                and misscomunicated parts of the product having to be fixed in the later stages of the project. Since this project was quite a large one, in terms of what we had to 
                produce, we made sure our lo-fi mock ups were near perfect before we started making the hi-fi vertions. This way we were able to save a lot of time in design process.

            <p>Benchmarking is the process of comparing businesses and their practices to the best in the industry or the industry standard. The way I like to this is by
                creating a table, writing out the bussineses websites I will be analysing and the specific things I will be looking at (for example - IA, Navigation, Clarity of CTA buttons).
                This way I get a clear idea on what parts of the product I need to pay the most attention to and how to avoid common mistakes. For this project we Benchmarked
            multiple restaurants and catering businesses that were similar to our client.</p>

            <h3><span class = "green">Svalegaarden Mest : Coding</span></h3>
            <p>Every single project I have worked on has required me to code some part of the website, and this wasnt an exception. We used HTML5, CSS and some minor
                JavaScript to make this functional prototype come to life. We used a grid to structure our website and to make it responsive. This was quite a massive 
            project so we attempted to make the layout quite simple, hovewer, it still required a lot of diversity when it comes to coding. The most important thing 
        about the code was that we had to keep it organised. We were 4 people, sometimes simultaneously, working in one css file, so without proper organisation 
    it would become a mess. We were able to sucefully keep an organising system going for the entire coding part of the project.  </p>

                <span class= "yellow">Project development method</span>- Scrum mixed with rapid prototyping. For this project we made the decision to attempt to work with SCRUM. 
                Scrum is a popular development method as it ensures productivity and high work quality. My role in our SCRUM was developer. We created a product backlog (everything the
                project needs) that was established during client meeting. Then we put these into "sprints" trying to organise them by each team members strenghts, to ensure everything 
                gets compleated on time.

            <h3> <span class = "green">Ungdomsringens Musikfestival : Atomic design</span></h3>
            <p>Atomic design is a design method that works by designing the smallest details first(atoms), and then grouping them to create bigger parts(molecules etc.). It's a quite interesting
                design method and can be quite useful when working with a project where small details are crucial. For this specific project we used atomic design throughout
            and it resulted in a very well planned out and detailed design.  </p>

            <p> A big part of a project is conducting user tests. The best way to see if something in your website will resonate with the user, is to ask them. One of my
                favorite tests to conduct is a 5 second test. During this test the user is shown a part of the website (usually to find out if the design and IA is 
                working as intended) and allowed to look at it for 5 seconds. After that, the person conducting the test asks the participant what did they notice first, 
         and what later on. For this project we used the 5s test to see if the users will be drawn to different buttons. </p>
